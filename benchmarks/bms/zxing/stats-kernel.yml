#
# Total, user and kernel time in milliseconds for the final (10th)
# iteration of the benchmark when run at 2.0 times the minimum heap
# size with the default G1 collector on a 32 way machine.
#
# Total time represents the wall clock time.
# User and kernel time are integrated across all threads, so their sum
# reflects the total integrated running time.
#
# For example, the triple '3534, 50975, 13496' indicates a wall clock
# of 3.532ms, user time of 50.975ms, kernel time of 13.496ms, so the
# benchmark had 64.471/3.532 = 18.25 utilization on the 32 core machine
# (about 57% parallel efficiency).
#
# Multiple invocations are reported.  These reflect the distribution
# (variance) of the workload across invocations.  Missing data reflects
# the workload failing to complete with that configuration.
#
# These results were gathered on the following hardware:
#
# AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16/32 cores.
# Linux 5.15.0.
