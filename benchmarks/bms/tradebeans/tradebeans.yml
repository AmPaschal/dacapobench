stats:
  EXT: 4		# nominal execution time (sec)
  HSS: 84		# nominal heap size sensitivity (slowdown with tight heap, as a percentage)
  LKG: 28		# nominal percent memory leakage (10 iterations / 1 iterations) (135/105)
  MHC: 105		# nominal minimum heap size (MB) (with compressed pointers)
  MHU: 151		# nominal minimum heap size (MB) without compressed pointers
  PAR: 15		# nominal parallel efficiency (speedup as percentage of ideal speedup for 8 threads)
  STD: 2		# nominal standard deviation among invocations at peak performance (as percentage of performance)
  WRM: 1		# nominal iterations to warm up to within 2.5% of best
